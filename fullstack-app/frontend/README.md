# Frontend Documentation

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application that consists of a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Laravel. The frontend is responsible for displaying information and details, while the backend handles user authentication and data management through an API.

## Folder Structure
- `src/components`: Contains reusable React components for the application.
- `src/pages`: Contains different pages of the application, each representing a unique view.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main component that sets up routing and renders the application layout.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the `build` directory.

## API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend via a RESTful API. Ensure that the backend server is running to handle API requests.
